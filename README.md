## Title: "Leveraging Pre-trained Models for Gene Regulatory Network Inference and Cell-Type-Specific Gene Program Extraction"

### Description:

The goal of this project is to explore the utility of pre-trained models, specifically the pre-trained blood model, for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and extracting cell-type-specific gene programs. GRNs provide valuable insights into the complex regulatory interactions between genes and their regulatory molecules, enabling a deeper understanding of cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

The project will leverage the pre-trained blood model to perform GRN inference and extract gene programs associated with different cell types. The main objectives are:

1. **GRN Inference**: Utilize the pre-trained blood model to infer gene regulatory networks, capturing the intricate relationships between genes and their regulators. This will involve applying computational methods and algorithms to reconstruct the underlying regulatory interactions from the pre-trained model's representations.

2. **Gene Program Extraction**: Identify and extract cell-type-specific gene programs from the inferred GRNs. Gene programs represent coordinated sets of genes that are co-regulated and involved in specific cellular processes or functions. By leveraging the pre-trained model's knowledge, the project aims to uncover these gene programs and their association with different cell types.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained model in identifying cell-type-specific gene programs. This will be achieved by using the Immune Human dataset as a validation resource. The project will assess the model's ability to accurately capture cell-type-specific activations within the extracted gene programs, providing a soft validation of its performance.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**: Develop effective visualization techniques to represent and interpret the inferred GRNs and the extracted cell-type-specific gene programs. This will facilitate the exploration and analysis of the regulatory relationships, as well as the identification of key regulators and potential therapeutic targets.

The project will contribute to the understanding of how pre-trained models can be effectively utilized for GRN inference and gene program extraction, potentially paving the way for more accurate and interpretable models in the field of systems biology and gene regulation studies.

Through this project, researchers and scientists will gain insights into the capabilities of pre-trained models in capturing regulatory relationships and identifying cell-type-specific gene programs, which can have significant implications for understanding biological processes, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic interventions.
